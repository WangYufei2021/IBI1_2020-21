# Define r rate as 1.2

# Define the number at the start

# Use for loop to circulate 5 times

# Each time 1.2 times of the number of the previous infectors will be added, that is n*r
# The total number of infectors is n + n*r

# Output r and the number of infectors
# r should be described as defined
